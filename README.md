Document-Classification
=======================

Classification of SGML documents using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

Requires Visual Studio 2010 to open.

The project is split into two sections:
* Classifier: A Number of classification algorithms that can be used for document classification.
    * Decision Tree
    * Perceptron
    * K Nearest Neighbors
    * Winnow Algorithm
* HLTAssignment: WPF Graphical front end to test the classifiers

I have not tried compiling this code in Mono, but the Classifiers section should theortically work.
